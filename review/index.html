                    <h1>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change 
                            approach as needed </h1> <h3>In making your own 
                            website, are you happy with the tools you used? 
                            E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello 
                            </h3>
                                    <p>I am very happy using tools such as VSC and Trello, although the latter I would have liked to use it in more depth. I think that a tool like Trello is fundamental to organize the work and be able to distribute the tasks in a team. VSC is a powerful tool that allows you to develop quickly because it is very intuitive and that helps you to optimize the work. Codepen is a very interesting tool that allows you to see in real time the result of your code. In the other, hand and a fundamental characteristic of Code Pen is you can take ideas from other user and reuse code for your own projects</p>

                                    appropriate</h1>
                                    <h3>Visual Studio Code, Codepen, 
                                    Trello</h3>
                                    
                                    <p>In addition to VSC, Codepen and Trello for me one of the tools that was very useful when developing this project was the Google console. Since with it I could test in real time changes that I wanted to do to later implement it in the code.</p>

                                            <p>I am very satisfied with my work although there are always things that can be improved. I am a very critical person and I look at the detail in everything I do, that's why I think that my website lacks a more professional finish, I think with a little more time and perhaps more experience I could finish it better. On the other hand as I have put a form I feel that the back end and how the data management that could be collected would be managed has not been developed.</p>
