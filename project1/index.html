                        <h1>PURPOSE OF IT IN MODERN BUSINESS.</h1>
                       
                           <p>Modern technology has made it possible to discover many functional and useful devices, such as the smart watch and the smartphone. With all these revolutions, technology has also made our lives easier, faster, better ... and more fun.
                        When it comes to the way we communicate, modern technology has had an impressive influence.</p>
                           <p>Digital technology has also changed. Social networks are not the only thing digital technology has achieved. Social networks are not the only way in which technology has had an impact on the lives of all.
                        Companies that previously only had a local impact have been able to grow and benefit from the arrival of the Internet that has made these companies compete internationally.</p>
                           <p>Before the advent of mobile technology, I had to look in a dictionary to understand the meaning of a word. Today, this phenomenon is still preserved, but it is used less and less; Now you can search it in a dictionary application that you downloaded or just search the Internet.
                        The future of technology is even more interesting than what is happening at the moment. In a few years, we will talk about cars without drivers and robots that work in factories.</p>
                           <p>I believe that technology advances very fast and those companies that do not adapt and incorporate new technologies for their business run a very high risk of losing customers, sales and prestige. The purpose of the technology is to do a more efficient job, spending less resources and having more scope.</p>
                      </div>

                     <div class="first">  
                        <h1>Methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h1>
                        
                           <p>The first method to take into account in any project is the planning and organization. A very basic but not less important method before using any technology is to draw up a work plan. The organization drawing the plan in stages with its clear objectives is what can determine the success or failure of any project.</p>
                           <p>Having a work team that meets the necessary skills to carry out the work is essential. The necessary skills will depend on the project. If it is a website, the team or the person should know HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as some framework. If it is a larger project or an app, we need knowledge in other programming languages such as C ++, Python and PHP.</p> <p>A designer or illustrator who is familiar with digital formats, a photographer and an SEO consultant may also be needed if it is a large project.</p>
                        
                           <p>The resources needed to carry out the project can be:</p>
                        
                            <ol class="list">
                              <li>System or program for the arrangement and distribution of tasks (for example, Trello or a whiteboard)</li>
                              <li>Count on the technology, connectivity and equipment necessary for the development of the project</li>
                              <li> Programs of design and creation of contents. (Ex.Adobe)</li>
                              <li> Shared environment where designers and developers can collaborate and build the project (ex.GitHub)</li>
                              <li> Local development environment (ex.Visual Studio)</li>
                              <li> A relaxed and collaborative environment</li>
                            </ol>
                   
                     </div>

                     <div class="first">
                        <h1>Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h1>
                         
                            <p>To begin planning the development of the project, we must begin by dividing the project into work teams. We will go from the simplest to the most complex. First of all, we will create a team responsible for the mock-up of the website. From this work, we will know how we have to place the content on the website.
                        At the same time, another team must take in charge of the creation or collecting the digital / written content that will be placed on the website (logos, photos, videos, information ..)</p>
                            <p>From the moment we have the model and material that we will place on the website, the team of developers will start with the creation of the website. This work will also collaborate with several people who, in turn, will be divided into Front-end (client side) or Back-end (server side).</p>

                      </div>
                      <div class="first">
                        <h1>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h1> 
                        
                          <h3>Miscalculated Time and Budget Frames</h3>
                            <p>Clients are always eager to have their projects rolled-out on time and even before the stipulated time at throwaway prices. In most cases, this keenness of the client leads to developers agreeing to a rather shorter or unrealistic and non-negotiable time frame for the project delivery at meagre rates. As a result, programmers are not able to deliver the project on time.</p>
                          <h3>Lack of Communication</h3>
                            <p>Another key aspect is the failure to set up effective communication channels and participative environment. Due to this, ideas or process flows get adrift and leads to lack of previews and interactions between the active project promoters and developers.</p> 
                          <h3>No End-user Involvement</h3>
                            <p>If the user's point of view is not taken into consideration while developing the IT project you are definitely calling in for trouble. So failure to find and engage the right users to participate in the software development process is extremely disastrous.</p>
                          <h3>Lack of Periodic Assessment</h3>
                            <p>Lack of client induced and developer mandated assessments, and failure in smartly establishing milestone points leads to improper assessments, which leads to irreparable or catastrophic failures.</p>
                          <h3>Lack of Quality Testing</h3>
                            <p>In most projects, the importance given to coding isn't given to testing. Testing calls for greater integrity and role in the entire software development lifecycle. Casual testing, testing under non-real time environments contribute to testing failures.</p> 
                      </div>
                      <div class="first">
                        <h1>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h1>
                        
                            <p>The criteria or type of technology that will be selected will be determined by the work project that we have. Therefore, we must also take into account the choice of client-side and server-side technologies.</p>
                      
                      
                           <h3>The Requirement of the Web Application Project</h3>
                            <p>When selecting technology stack for web development, the type of development is the primary thing that needs to be considered. For example, when developing a simple information-only website, there are fewer requirements of the tool, whereas, for a fully-functional e-commerce platform solution, the tool requirement naturally increases because of the complexity of the development process. Additionally, the expected traffic rate, images, and videos sever and load balancing technologies, etc. are also some important evaluation aspects to determine the requirements of the web development and consecutively help in measuring the type of technology stack.</p>
                        
                           <h3>Prefer Open-Source Technologies</h3>
                            <p>It is recommended to opt for open-source solutions when developing software because this way there would be no need to work from the scratch, thus saving a lot of time. It is also considered more of a secure option. Once you have selected a particular tech slack, scrutinize it thoroughly to ensure it adheres to all the fundamental elements. The type of license, a framework that comes with required features, analyzing the Github history and stars, easy to understand code, comprehensive documentation to ensure security, etc. are some of the key factors that must be checked upon by the company.</p>
                        
                           <h3>The Budget Benchmark</h3>
                            <p>Other than paying for the technology to build the stack, the company will also be paying the team of developers who are going to write the codes. For more advanced code, more qualified developers would be required and hence more will be the overall cost. Higher cost doesn’t mean that one should comprise the quality of the project. In fact, companies must use only high-quality programming languages, servers, and database for the particular solution. As for saving money, investing in a dedicated team that has the experience of working with requirement technology. Then a company only need to reimburse money for the time needed to complete the project. And once it is released the team can be reduced to merely support and maintenance employees.</p>
                        
                           <h3>The Expertise of the Development Team</h3>
                            <p>Expertise level of the development team on working with different technology stack is a crucial factor to think upon. The task isn’t completed merely by getting a tech stack; rather the actual job starts after that. It is evident that developers may deal with setbacks when developing codes and in order to find prolific solutions, utmost expertise is required because the project typically runs on a deadline thus; work has to be executed without wasting any precious time. Therefore, a web tech stack should have a large developer community along with comprehensive and thorough documentation. Additionally, ensure that the stack is easy to test because certain technologies need Test Driven Development (TDD) where first testing is done then the team gets to the coding process. It is done in order to assure the quality and speed of the project.</p>
                        
                           <h3>The Degree of Scalability</h3>
                            <p>Scalability entails the ability of website or app to handle the workload. As the number of work piles up, the app must have the ability to handle the growth. Therefore, it is vital to select a tech slack that will accommodate future development and advancement of the application irrespective of horizontal or vertical growth. Horizontal dimensions entail that product is run on numerous servers simultaneously to handle traffic influx. Whereas in the vertical dimension, more products can be installed to sustain project from collapsing in the future.</p>
                            <p>These were some of the significant factors that companies must consider while selecting a technology stack. It all starts with understanding the project and its primary requirement and then comparing different technologies to choose the one that complements those requirements with utmost efficiency.</p>

                            <p>When I planed the project with Trello, I found it very useful to fragment the project in stages. I think this application allows you to organize each stage of a project very well with the simplicity of a sticky note.</p>
                            <p>Controls code version of Git and Git Hub manages the changes that are made in the code of the project so that we can collaborate on different projects. This system is very safe for developers because it creates a project history that allows you to go backwards if the new code has errors or does not work.</p>

                           <h3>The right to access</h3> 
                            <p>This means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.</p>
                           <h3>The right to be forgotten</h3> 
                            <p> If consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.</p>
                           <h3>The right to data portability</h3> 
                            <p> Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.</p>
                           <h3>The right to be informed</h3> 
                            <p> This covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.</p>
                           <h3>The right to have information corrected</h3> 
                            <p> This ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.</p>
                           <h3>The right to restrict processing</h3> 
                            <p> Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.</p>
                           <h3>The right to object</h3> 
                            <p> This includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.</p>
                           <h3>The right to be notified</h3> 
                            <p> If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.</p>
                        
                        <p>The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.
                        These eight new regulations pose a challenge for developers when it comes to the collection and handling of user data.</p>
