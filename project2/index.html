                        <h1>Describing the content and layout for each page</h1>

                            <p>My website has been organised into sections or subpages with the main menu that gives you access to each of them.</p><p>I have used Flexbox to create the structure. The canvas has been split into five sections (header, two sides, main and footer). I have placed a piece of brief personal description in the main part of the home page. On the left side of the screen I placed a photo in a circular frame. Previously I have removed the colors to appear in black and white and I used CSS to create a circular frame and I gave it an animated effect that makes the photo rotate 180 degrees when the mouse is passed over it.</p><p> Below the photo, I have placed my contact information creating a button (link) that takes the user to a contact page with a form that will collect your data. Under this button, I have created the buttons for LinkedIn, Codepen and GitHub, all linked to my profiles.</p><p> Then, in the lower part of the same side, I placed a video to make the section fun for the user. In the right side of the screen, I have added some works as an example of a Codepen portfolio. The footer is very simple, with my name written on it.</p><p> All this finished in a yellow and grey combination with blue touches make the website pleasant and joyful for those who visit it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="first">
                        <h1>Describing copyright and other constraints 
                        affecting websites.</h1>
                             <p>There is <b>NO copyright</b> in a website as such, but copyright will usually protect some or all of the elements of a website</p>
                        <h3>TEXT</h3>
                             <p>Website text will usually be protected as a literary work or as a collection of literary works.  This protection is available to text – and other kinds of recorded symbolic code – irrespective of literary merit.  However, text will need to be “original”: it will need to be the product of the author's effort, labour and skill, and must not be copied from elsewhere</p>
                        <h3>HTML</h3>
                            <p>Hypertext mark-up language (HTML) will incorporate the website text, but add with added mark-up: tags indicating meta-information, headings, paragraphs, image sources and positions, text characteristics, page divisions and so on.</p> 

                            <p>In one sense, then, the HTML of a website is a derivative work of the text of a website.  Much HTML is standard, and any given page of HTML may not have the requisite originality to be protected separately from the protection afforded to the text itself.  If it does have the requisite originality, it will be protected as a literary work.</p>
                        <h3>CSS</h3>
                            <p>Cascading style sheets (CSS) are largely responsible for the specification of the appearance of a web page.   CSS directives are applied to mark-up by web browsers in the process of rendering a web page.  They influence or determine such matters as the positioning and spacing of elements on the page, the colour of page elements and font type, size and style.</p>

                            <p>On the face of it, CSS files should be protected by literary copyright.  However, as with HTML, there will be cases where the originality hurdle has not been surmounted.  In other cases, however, where the originality of the CSS can be demonstrated, protection should be available.</p> 
                                
                            <p>Because of the limited vocabulary and simple syntax of both HTML and CSS, it may be difficult to prove copying where there are any material differences between the “original” and the “copy”.</p>
                        <h3>Software code</h3>
                            <p>Almost all modern websites incorporate software of one kind or another, from simply form submission scripts to complex content management and ecommerce systems.  Software code proper, whether in an interpreted or compiled language, allows for a greater range of expression than of HTML and CSS - notwithstanding the wide use of established algorithms and design patterns - and accordingly it receives more generous treatment at the hands of copyright.</p> 

                            <p>Again, it is literary copyright that protects software programs.</p>
                        <h3>Logos</h3>
                            <p>A graphic logo will usually be protected as an original artistic work.  The law of registered trade marks and/or passing off may also protect against the misappropriation of a logo.</p>
                        <h3>Illustrations and photographs</h3>
                            <p>Illustrations and photographs, like logos, may be protected as original artistic works.</p>
                        <h3>Music and video</h3>
                            <p>In copyright terms, music that is streamed or downloaded from a website is a “sound recording”, whilst video is “film”.  Both sound recordings and films are protected by special entreprenerial copyrights.  No originality is required for the protection of the entreprenerial copyrights.</p>
                            <p>In addition, there will usually be underlying rights. In the case of sound recordings of music, the underlying rights may include musical copyright in a composition, literary copyright in a song, and performers' rights.  In the case of a film drama, the underlying rights may include, dramatic copyright in the screenplay, musical copyright in the soundtrack, artistic copyright in any graphics and images used in the film, and so on.</p>
                        <h3>Brand names</h3>
                            <p>Subject to my comments above regarding logos, brand names – such as COCA COLA, KODAK and GILETTE – will normally fall foul of the de minimis rule: copyright will not protect them, because they are too small.  They may well, of course, be protected by the law of trade marks and/or passing off.</p>
                        <h3>Look and feel</h3>
                            <p>The starting point for considering the question of whether the look and feel of a website will be protected is: it won't.  This was confirmed in Navitaire v Easyjet, where the court found that the look and feel of a produced by Navitaire for Easyjet website was not protected by copyright.</p>
                            <p>However, notwithstanding the case law, it is easy to image a website where the general design constitutes a graphic work, and the copying of that work would constitute infringement.</p>
                        <h3>Website/business idea</h3>
                            <p>Famously, there is no copyright in an idea.  Insofar as business ideas and ideas for websites and business processess instantiated in websites are concerned, that maxim holds true.  In most cases, under English law, the only way to protect such ideas is by means of the law of confidence and contractual non-disclosure agreements.  And those protections fall away once the site is live.</p>

                    <div class="first">
                        <h1>Describing access issues that need taking into 
                         account</h1> 
                        <h3>Describe issues that people with 
                        disabilities may face when using webpages and 
                        how we can overcome them.</h3>
                    
                            <p>This group is a very heterogeneous group. There is physical, intellectual, organic disability and infinite degrees and types.
                            However, there are significant advances in this regard. For example, Google has launched a series of inclusive tools:</p>
                    
                            <p><b><em>Accessibility Extension</em></b>. Add a panel and bars to facilitate navigation.</p>
                    
                            <p><b><em>High contrast.</em></b> It is an application that changes the contrast values of the screen, so that people with certain types of visual impairment can see it more clearly.</p>
                    
                             <p><b><em>ChromeVox</em></b> It is a tool that reads aloud the content of a web page when the mouse is passed over.</p>
                    
                        <h3>In addition to these improvements for navigation, there are a number of tips that as a web designer we must take into account to improve the accessibility of a page. Among them are the following:</h3>
                    
                            <p><b>Tags alt</b></p>
                    
                            <p>When you mouse over an image on a website, the little words that appear are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website aloud), alt tags are read aloud and are the only way for a user to know what It is the image.</p>
                    
                            <p><b>Subtitles and transcriptions</b></p>
                    
                            <p>Videos must always be subtitled, so that people with hearing disabilities can understand their content.</p>
                    
                            <p><b>Colour</b></p>
                    
                             <p>Choosing colors wisely is useful for a website with any type of audience. The simultaneous use of bright colors should be avoided and be careful with combinations of yellow, blue and green. The black text on a white background is the best general practice, since it is legible for most audiences.</p>
                    
                            <p><b>Links</b></p>
                    
                            <p>When a link is embedded in a message, it is more useful to describe it, than simply telling the reader to click on it.</p>
                    
                            <p><b>Responsive design</b></p>
                    
                             <p>There are innumerable accessibility requirements and some websites even include a guide on this topic. Trying to put yourself in the place of users and foresee the most complicated situations in terms of access for people with disabilities is a requirement that we must include from the beginning of the project we want to start.</p>
                    
                            <p>In this way, working to achieve a quality web design and the application of responsive design is the main objective for a better user experience and, ultimately, a world where there is space for everyone.</p>
                    
                             <p>W3C has a comprehensive guide and information on how we can improve the way we create quality websites that are accessible to everyone.</p>

                        and systems used in terms of productivity and 
                        efficiency</h1>

                        done it in teams?</h3> 
                    
                            <p>When creating a website there are many aspects to take into account, many technologies that you must apply and many parts to develop. I believe it is essential to work with a team for any professional project.
                             By working as a team the tasks will be distributed and so each one can take care of a part of the project and be more efficient in the development.</p>
                            <p>Through Github, we can mix our code with that of our team and keep moving forward in the project. This tool is fundamental when it comes to developing and working as a team because it will optimize the work, it will allow us to control errors and be able to return to an earlier point if necessary.</p>

The people who are going to work on that project should have good communication between them and the knowledge necessary to develop the proposal. When developing a project with several ramifications it is essential to have well controlled the roles that each component of the team will develop to avoid falling into redundancy.

                    More and more mobile users have become more demanding and impatient. In just a few seconds, you can already determine if an application likes it or not.</p>
                    
                    <p>If the application is too complicated or slow, it will not only pass to the competitor but also publish a negative review of your site on social networks that could harm your reputation.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a great qualified competence, a great test is carried out on the key to success.
                    
                    The tests are based on risk tests and privacy security. From the tests at the external level to the code itself, which is essential for a good test.</p>
                    
                    <p>Below I will detail four types of software tests that will work in a QA or tester:</p>
                    
                    
                    <p><b>Functional software tests</b></p>
                    
                    <p>They are the ones that check the behavior of the system, the subsystem or component software. They are usually tests and document in requirements requirements or in cases of use.
                    
                    The Black Box Tests are also known, since the external behavior of the system is valued. Among some of its tests we can find the Safety Tests and the Interoperability Tests.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Non-functional software tests</b></p>
                    
                    <p>This group of tests includes Performance, Load, Stress, Usability, Maintainability, Reliability and Portability.
                    
                    The tests are based on the external behavior of the system.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Structural software tests</b></p>
                    <p>In this type of tests the internal behaviour is investigated more, the components are reviewed and their integration. White box tests.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Tests of regression software or re-tests.</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Regression tests are performed once an error has been corrected to confirm that it has been eliminated.
                    
                    In addition, we have proved that the element that has been modified has been modified again.</p>
